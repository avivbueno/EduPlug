## EduPlug - A school managing app

http://eduplug.co.il

To setup the project you need to do the following by order:

1. Open the eduplug.sln file on visual studio.
2. Re-add all the web references because visual studio opens different port every time.
3. Run the project.

From here you can use the project in 3 different account types:

Notice: In order to register a new user, you need to first login as a manager
and allow this man to register by typing the first name, last name and ID.
